## What Are Outlier Scores?

Outlier scores are numerical values assigned to each data point by an anomaly detection algorithm. These scores quantify the degree to which each point is considered an outlier, based on its deviation from the expected norm. **The higher the outlier score, the more likely the data point is an anomaly**. Here’s a deeper look at their role:

- **Purpose of Outlier Scores:**
  - **Quantitative Measure:** They provide a quantitative measure to rank data points based on their “outlierness.” This allows for a more nuanced interpretation of which points are most unusual.
  - **Thresholding:** By setting a threshold on these scores, data points can be classified as inliers (normal) or outliers (anomalous).

- **Calculation:**
  - **Algorithm-Specific:** Different algorithms compute outlier scores using various methods. For instance:
    - **Distance-Based Methods:** These calculate scores based on the distance of a point from its neighbors (e.g., Local Outlier Factor).
    - **Density-Based Methods:** These use density estimations to assign scores (e.g., DBSCAN).
    - **Angle-Based Methods:** For ABOD, scores are derived from the variance of angles between data points.

- **Interpretation:**
  - **High Scores:** Indicate that the point is an outlier. For instance, in a distance-based approach, a point far away from the cluster centroid would have a high outlier score.
  - **Low Scores:** Suggest the point is similar to its neighbors and likely an inlier.

## Importance of Visualizing Outlier Scores

Visualizing the distribution of outlier scores is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Threshold Selection:** It helps in choosing an appropriate threshold for classifying data points as outliers. You can visually assess where to draw the line between normal and anomalous points.
2. **Understanding Data Distribution:** The histogram provides insights into the overall distribution of scores, allowing you to understand if the data contains a distinct separation between normal points and anomalies.
3. **Identifying Anomalies:** Peaks or tails in the distribution may indicate regions with concentrated outliers, guiding further investigation.
4. **Evaluating Algorithm Performance:** Analyzing the score distribution can help assess the effectiveness of the algorithm. Ideally, outliers should have significantly higher scores than inliers, forming a distinguishable group.

## Conclusion

Visualizing outlier scores will provide valuable insights into the data’s structure and the algorithm’s performance.

By understanding outlier scores and their distribution, you can make informed decisions about anomaly detection thresholds and gain deeper insights into your data.
